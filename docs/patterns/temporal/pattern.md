# temporal

The `temporal` tab of the MatWerk workbook currently holds **173 rows**. Every row follows the same shape, and that shape is the pattern below: a **entity** instance carrying the row's identity, denoted by **value node** nodes that hold its values, and object properties pointing at entities in other tabs.

*Generated from the live sheet and MWO 3.0.1 by `scripts/gen_patterns.py` — regenerate it rather than editing it by hand.*

## The pattern

```ontoink
source: patterns/temporal/pattern.ttl
height: 560px
reasoning: false
```

> Drag the nodes, change the layout, or use **Group** to collapse a namespace. The picture is the example only; the declarations and annotations behind it are in [`module.ttl`](module.ttl).

## Columns

| Column | ROBOT | Property | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| label | `A` | `rdfs:label` | label |
| denoted by | `I` | `obo:IAO_0000235` | denoted by |
| has first instance | `I` | `obo:BFO_0000222` | has first instant |
| has last instance | `I` | `obo:BFO_0000224` | has last instant |

## How to read it

* The **entity** is typed `obo:BFO_0000038` (one-dimensional temporal region) and carries only its identity, its label, and links.
* A column marked `I` does **not** contain a value — it contains the *label of another instance*, which ROBOT resolves at build time. That is why every value node needs a unique label, and why a typo produces a silently missing relation rather than an error.
* Columns marked `A` are literals on the entity itself.

## Components (value nodes)

These value-node types live in the workbook's shared `req_2` tab but belong to this pattern — they exist to describe it, and are counted by how often this tab references them.

| Component | Class | References |
|---|---|---|
| zero-dimensional temporal region | `obo:BFO_0000148` | 11 |
| specification datum | `<https://w3id.org/pmd/co/PMD_0060009>` | 10 |

## Query it

Retrieve instances of this pattern from the MSE Knowledge Graph ([SPARQL endpoint](https://nfdi.fiz-karlsruhe.de/matwerk/sparql)):

```sparql
SELECT ?x ?label WHERE { ?x a <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000038> ; <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> ?label } LIMIT 10
```

The rows behind it are curated in the [`temporal` tab of the workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OyoWwcX4zUtrJilwXdtTooavELw278nQSNW2oniBBsk/edit#gid=1265818056).

## Competency questions

The questions this pattern exists to answer. Each is answerable against the published graphs.

1. Over which period did a given project, event or role run?
2. Which resources were created or published in a given year?

## Pattern metadata

The [Ontology Design Patterns](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org) content-ODP annotation schema, in the community's own field order, so a reader who knows ODP pages can read this one without translation.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | temporal |
| **Submitted by** | the NFDI-MatWerk consortium |
| **Also Known As** | the `temporal` template tab of the NFDI-MatWerk workbook |
| **Intent** | To represent a one-dimensional temporal region in the MSE Knowledge Graph: its identity, the value nodes that describe it, and its links to the other entities the NFDI-MatWerk consortium records. |
| **Domains** | research data management; NFDI consortium structure |
| **Competency Questions** | Over which period did a given project, event or role run?; Which resources were created or published in a given year? |
| **Solution description** | An entity individual typed `obo:BFO_0000038` carries identity and label; each descriptive value is a separate *value node* individual reached by `obo:IAO_0000235` (denoted by); links to other patterns are object properties onto those entities. Identity is a minted IRI `msekg:<epoch_ms><counter>`, so re-running the pipeline is idempotent. |
| **Reusable OWL Building Block** | [`module.ttl`](module.ttl) — the example together with the axioms of every term it uses, extracted from the ontology, so the file stands alone |
| **Consequences** | Values become reusable and independently addressable, and a value may be shared by many entities. The cost: every `I` reference resolves **by label**, so labels must be unique and a typo yields a silently missing relation rather than an error. |
| **Scenarios** | “temporal region 158” is a one-dimensional temporal region, with has first instance “2/29/2024”; has last instance “9/30/2026”. |

### Formal characterisation

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| **Consistency** | **consistent** — ROBOT 1.9.10, reasoner HermiT, merged with MWO 3.0.1 |
| **DL expressivity** | `RRESTRCUCINTUNIVRESTREROIF` — measured on the pattern together with a STAR module of exactly the terms it uses, so the figure describes this pattern rather than the whole ontology |
| **Axioms / logical axioms** | 8 / 3 |
| **Classes / individuals** | 2 / 3 |

## Consistency

`pattern.ttl` is checked against MWO 3.0.1 with ROBOT (`--reasoner hermit`) — the same reasoner `process_spreadsheets` runs over every generated module. A pattern that contradicts the ontology fails the documentation build.
