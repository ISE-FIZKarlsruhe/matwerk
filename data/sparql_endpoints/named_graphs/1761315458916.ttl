Sasha Bruns: nfdicore:dataset and ioa:data set are not equivalent, due to their differing conceptualizations of what constitutes a iao:data item, which is a superclass of iao:data set. In the nfdicore ontology, a dataset may not necessarily align perfectly with the definition of a data item, since this definition implies a level of accuracy that may not always apply to datasets in their entirety. While a nfdicore:dataset may contain data items, it doesn't necessarily qualify as a data item itself under the strict definition provided by ioa:dataset.

Those natural â as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed â units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organismâs sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.
