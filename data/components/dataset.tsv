Various features and feature descriptors (explained in the related publication) are provided, as well as the computation thereof. The features were used in a machine learning regression setting (see related publication). The data is split into two sets, one with 30.000 samples containing only one inclusion type per RVE and another set of 1.500 samples containing mixed inclusions. The repository comes with a data loader suited for flexible indexing. (2023-02-27) 							url 47	Hybrid machine-learned homogenization: Bayesian data mining and convolutional neural networks

In this work, we investigate relationships between 3D microstructure and effective diffusivity and permeability, based on a dataset of 90,000 structures and using analytical formulas, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Herein, the codes in Matlab and Python/Tensorflow necessary to investigate the prediction models and reproduce the results of the paper are supplied. Also, microstructures together with their computed geometrical descriptors and effective properties are included.

https://purls.helmholtz-metadaten.de/msekg/174514252296724	dataset	Automated analysis of scanning electron microscopic images for assessment of hair surface damage		dataset publishing process 22				Mechanical damage of hair can serve as an indicator of health status and its assessment relies on the measurement of morphological features via microscopic analysis, yet few studies have categorized the extent of damage sustained, and instead, have depended on qualitative profiling based on the presence or absence of specific features. We describe the development and application of a novel quantitative measure for scoring hair surface damage in scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images without predefined features, and automation of image analysis for characterization of morphological hair damage after exposure to an explosive blast. Application of an automated normalization procedure for SEM images revealed features indicative of contact with materials in an explosive device and characteristic of heat damage, though many were similar to features from physical and chemical weathering. Assessment of hair damage with tailing factor, a measure of asymmetry in pixel brightness histograms and proxy for surface roughness, yielded 81% classification accuracy to an existing damage classification system, indicating good agreement between the two metrics. Further ability of tailing factor to score features of hair damage reflecting explosion conditions demonstrates the broad applicability of the metric to assess damage to hairs containing a diverse set of morphological features.
