	dataset	people		named_graph_iri						results:named_g that contains these		MSE Knowledge Graph v1.0					
	dataset	org		named_graph_iri_2						detect patterns from named_graph					conians annotation property to refer to the class		
										federated insert, select all the classes from the named_graph that contains 							
										in our mwo, we have mwo:Device							
										in another ontology, x:ttl_machine, subclassOf mwo:device							
										:contain TTlmachine							
										the t_box should be consistance, befor we should check the consistency, if the inconsistence, we need to fic that							
											if consistence then add it to the kg
